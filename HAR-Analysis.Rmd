```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,cache = TRUE)
```

### Loading the data

Let's download the training and testing files.

```{r messages=FALSE}
trLoc = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
tstLoc = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
download.file(trLoc,destfile = "training.csv")
download.file(tstLoc,destfile = "testing.csv")
training <- read.csv("training.csv",na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv("testing.csv",na.string=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```

Let's now partition the training data into train and test sets for us to get the model correct. 

```{r}
library(caret)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]
myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```

### Standardizing the data

Let's look at the training data:

```{r}
str(myTraining)
```

We notice there's lots of columns that have NA values. So let's clean up those.


#### 0 variance columns

We'll remove any variables that have 0 impact on variance using the `nearZeroVar` function.

```{r}
nzv <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTraining <- myTraining[,nzv$nzv==FALSE]

nzv<- nearZeroVar(myTesting,saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTesting <- myTesting[,nzv$nzv==FALSE]

dim(myTraining);dim(myTesting)
```

Remove the 1st column as that's just the row number. 
```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```

#### Removing NA values

Let's also remove any columns and rows that have >70% NA values.

```{r}
training_3 <- myTraining
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) {
    if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .7) {
        for(j in 1:length(training_3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(training_3)[j]) ) == 1)  {
                training_3 <- training_3[ , -j]
            }   
        } 
    }
}
myTraining <- training_3
rm(training_3)
```

Now make sure that the testing and myTesting data sets are having the same columns as myTraining.

```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58])  # remove the classe column
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]         # allow only variables in myTesting that are also in myTraining
testing <- testing[clean2]             # allow only variables in testing that are also in myTraining
```

Make sure the data types of the columns are the same across the training,testing data sets.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
    for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) == 1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}

# To get the same class between testing and myTraining
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing)
# Remove column 1 from the testing data set
testing <- testing[-1,] 
```

### Prediction models

#### RPart classification

We'll do a simple decision tree classification using `rpart` and determine the accuracy of our model.

```{r}
library(rpart)
set.seed(12345)
fit <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
```

Now let's predict the classification of our `myTesting` and see the accuracy in the confusion matrix.

```{r}
library(caret)
predRPart <- predict(fit, myTesting, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(predRPart,myTesting$classe)
```

The Decision Tree model gave us a accuracy level of __88%__

#### Random Forest model

Let's now try usign a random forest prediction model:

```{r}
library(randomForest)
set.seed(12345)
fitRF <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=myTraining)
predRF <- predict(fitRF, myTesting, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(predRF, myTesting$classe)
```

The accuracy of this model is __99.9%__ which is better than the decision tree using `rpart`.

Lets then use the random forest model to predict our test sample.

```{r}
predTest <- predict(fitRF,newdata=testing,type="class")
predTest
```

Write the predictions out to a file

```{r}
write.csv(predTest,"test_predictions.csv")
```
